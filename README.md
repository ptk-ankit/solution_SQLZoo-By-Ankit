# solution_SQLZoo-By-Ankit

##Overview
SQL Zoo is a bit error prone but will certainly make you think deeply in SQL! Hopefully you didn't spend too much time scratching your head on these problems. Sometimes its best just to move on and not obsess over them. However, if you were able to get the correct answers for all of these... wow!

Reviewing Your Solution
While reviewing your solution you should single out those problems that were most difficult. The .sql files in this repo each are named after a section of SQL Zoo. You'll find the correct answers in each of these files under the corresponding question in SQL comments.

Cheating
If you want to go ahead and cheat now, enter ?answer=1 at the end of the URL on a given SQL Zoo page. You'll see "Cheat Mode" in the bottom right corner and all the correct answers will be populated for you. Yup, we waited until now to tell you.
